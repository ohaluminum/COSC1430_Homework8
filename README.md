### Exception Handling &amp; Template Functions &amp; Template Classes

:exclamation::grey_exclamation:This Homework contains Professor's example of overloading `==`  and `+` operator!!!

> For this homework, you will learn how to use templates by implementing a TreasureMap class. This class accepts a series of steps that will lead to the treasure. Since each step can be of any type such as a string, a number, or another class/struct, the usage of a template is needed. In addition, you will need to incorporate error handling methods such as throwing and catching an exception when reading treasure maps in the form of input text files.

#### TreasureMap

> TreasureMap class is a template class. It represents a treasure map that holds a series of steps. Each step is of a template class type. The user can traverse backwards and forwards, combine, and compare each maps.

***Define TreasureMap class with the following members:***

*private:*

- steps is a dynamic array of type T
- current_step is an int, starts at 0, indicate the index of the current step in the treasure map
- total_steps is an int that indicates how many elements are currently in steps
- max_steps is an int that indicates the maximum number of elements steps can hold

*public:*

- default constructor: set total_steps and current_step to 0, max_steps to 10, and initialize steps to an array of 10 elements
- TreasureMap(int max_steps) this constructor sets the max_steps, and initialize steps array to max_steps
- getSteps() This function returns the dynamic array T
- getCurrentStep() This function returns the current_step
- getTotalSteps() This function returns the total_steps

> Other getter and setter functions are not required
      
- addStep() a void function that takes in a T element, add it to steps and increment total_steps. If total_steps is equal to max_steps, show this message and don't add:
        
> Cannot add more steps, TreasureMap is full
      
- removeStep() a void function that takes in an int index and remove the element in steps at that index (make sure to decrement total_steps).
      
- nextStep() a void function that prints this message and then increment the current_step:
        
> Going from `current element` to `next element`, where current element is the T element at current_step index of steps and next element is current_step + 1. 
         
> If current_step is already the last step, print this message instead: "Cannot goto next step, treasure has already been found!"

> If after incrementing current_step and reaching the last step, print: "Congratulations, you have found the treasure!"

- backtrack() a void function that prints this message and then decrement the current_step
        
> Backtracking from `current element` to `previous element`, where current element is the T element at current_step index of steps and previous element is current_step - 1 
         
> If current_step is already the last step, print this message instead: "Cannot backtrack, you're at the very first step!"
        
- Overload the + operator, if the total_steps don't match then return a blank map (made using the default constructor). Else make a new TreasureMap and each step in the new map is the addition of map 1's step with map 2's step. For example, given map1 with steps 1, 2, 3 and map2 with steps 1,3,4, map3 = map1 + map2. map3's steps will be 2,5,7.

- Overload the == operator, returns true if the total_steps match, and each element in steps is equal to each other. Return false otherwise

***NOTE: Please implement all of the above methods of the TreasureMap class in "TreasureMap.h" for this assignment.***

#### Location

> Since it's quite difficult to follow a treasure map whose step is only either words or numbers, it's better to combine both the name of the location and it's coordinates into the same object. Hence we will create the Location class.

> The Location class has been provided to you with no changes needed with the following members:

*private:*
    
- name is a private string
- x is a private float
- y is a private float
      
*public:*
    
- A constructor that accepts the name, x, and y
- Functions getName(), getX(), getY() returns name, x, and y respectively
- Functions setName(), setX(), setY() sets name, x, and y respectively
- overload the addition operator (+): create a new Location, it's name, x, and y will be the addition of the original two locations. For example, location A is ("Houston", 1, 2) and location B is ("Austin", 2, 3), A + B = ("HoustonAustin", 3, 5)
- overload the compare operator (==) to return true if the name, x, and y are the same and return false otherwise.

#### FileReadException

> This class will be the exception thrown and catch during the file reading process

***Define TreasureMap class with the following members:***

*private:*
    
- err_message a string that holds the error message
    
*public:*
      
- a constructor that takes in a string and assign it to err_message
- getMessage() returns err_message

#### main.cpp

***In the main.cpp, you need to complete the following two functions.***

`readMap()`

> This is a template function that takes in two arguments, a string file_name and an int for max_steps. It returns a TreasureMap of type T.

> This function first opens the file with the file_name and if it doesn't exists, throws a FileReadException exception with this message: "Error reading map: `file_name` does not exists!"

> There are three types of input files, including string, int, and char. Each line in an input file is an item. For example, an input file with all strings would look like:

```
Bob
Amy
Houston

(None of the strings will have spaces)
```
> And an input file with all integers looks like:
```
1
23
14
15
```        
> The function will create a new TreasureMap of type T, then for each item in the input file, use the extraction operator `>>` to read in a new element of type T and add it into the map with addStep() member function of the TreasureMap class.

> However, if there are more items in the input file than the provided max_steps (2nd argument of readMap), then throw a FileReadException with this message: "Error reading map: `file_name` contains more than `max_steps` steps!"
      
> After reading (without issues), the function returns that TreasureMap object.

***About reading the location input file***

***You don't have to worry about the location input file being different format, an overload of the >> operator has already been provided in the main() function for you. The readMap() function can be applied to the location text file without issues.***

`main()`

> The main function has been partially completed, firstly it takes in three variables from user input in this order:

- a string (without space) for the file name to be read with readMap()
- a string for the type of input file, can either be "string", "int", "char", or "location" this determines the type of input file so we can call readMap() with the right variable type.
- an int for the max_steps (second argument in readMap)

> Based on the input file type, your task is to create a new TreasureMap and use readMap() to read the new map. Then set a for loop that runs for the number of total_steps in the new TreasureMap, for each loop, call the map's nextStep() function.

> The readMap() functions called inside main() has been enclosed with a try catch block, your task is to define a FileReadException in the catch block and print out it's message with cout and getMessage().

***Example main input:***

`sample_input.txt string 10`

***Example main output:***
```
Going from A to B
Going from B to C
Going from C to D
Going from D to E
Congratulations, you have found the treasure!
```
***sample_input.txt:***
```
A
B
C
D
E
```
